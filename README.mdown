# White Label Styleguide

## A sass/haml resource for clean white-label applications.

Sassy-seeds uses a standard module for sass to separate visual and positional styling and avoid adding classes to the semantic markup. The standard module allows you to copy the generic visual-stylesheets and use them with any sass/compass compatible application.

Built with:

* [Sinatra Bootstrap](http://github.com/adamstac/sinatra-bootstrap/)
* [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [Compass](https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass)
* [Grid Coordinates](https://github.com/adamstac/grid-coordinates)
* [Meyer Reset](https://github.com/adamstac/meyer-reset)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [Modernizr](http://www.modernizr.com/)
